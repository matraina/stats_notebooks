Statistics & Probability

Welcome to stats_notebooks! Here, I use Jupyter Notebooks to offer intuitive explanations to problems in statistics and probability. When applicable, I generally provide both analytical and Monte-Carlo solutions. 

Overview

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks, each dedicated to a specific problem/topic within statistics and probability. Examples are taken from the following books/links: 
- https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-62840-0  (Luca Lista's Statistical Methods for Data Analysis in Particle Physics)
- https://global.oup.com/academic/product/one-thousand-exercises-in-probability-9780198847618?cc=us&lang=en& (Grimmett's and Stirzaker's One Thousand Exercises in Probability)
- https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~gravner/MAT135A/resources/chpr.pdf (Twenty problems in probability from J. Gravner UCDavis course)
- https://mbapreponline.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fifty_challenging_problems_in__2.pdf (F. Mosteller's Fifty challenging problems in probability)

To get started, clone this repository and ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can install Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda or pip:

Copy code\n
pip install notebook\n
After installation, navigate to the cloned repository's directory and run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:

Copy code\n
jupyter notebook\n
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser, where you can open and interact with the notebooks.
