Statistics & Probability

Welcome to stats_notebooks, where I delve into the fascinating world of statistics and probability! Here, I use Jupyter Notebooks to offer intuitive explanations, demonstrations, and solutions to results and problems in the field. 

Overview

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks, each dedicated to a specific problem/topic within statistics and probability. Examples are taken from the following books/links: 
- https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-62840-0  (Luca Lista's Statistical Methods for Data Analysis in Particle Physics)
- https://global.oup.com/academic/product/one-thousand-exercises-in-probability-9780198847618?cc=us&lang=en& (Grimmett's and Stirzaker's One Thousand Exercises in Probability)
- https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~gravner/MAT135A/resources/chpr.pdf
- https://mbapreponline.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fifty_challenging_problems_in__2.pdf (F. Mosteller's Fifty challenging problems in probability)

To get started, clone this repository and ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can install Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda or pip:

Copy code
pip install notebook
After installation, navigate to the cloned repository's directory and run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:

Copy code
jupyter notebook
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser, where you can open and interact with the notebooks.
