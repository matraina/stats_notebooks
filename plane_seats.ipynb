After that, each person takes the assigned seat if it is unoccupied, and one of unoccupied seats at random otherwise.

    "##### Let's make sense of this result (which holds for any $n>1, n \\in \\mathbb N$). For any passenger $j$ preceding the last whose seat was taken, they can be assigned any one of the $n-j+1$ remaining seats. There are 3 case scenarios: 1. They are assigned a random seat which isn't the first or last person's. 2. They are assigned the first person's seat. 3. They are assigned the last person's seat. Case number 1. eventually falls back to either case 2. or 3. as people are assigned seats, and there is no possible scenario where both first and last person's seats are assigned before the last person. This is because once either the first or last seat is taken, all people coming next get their assigned seat (except, possibly, the last). Thus, the last person either gets their seat or the first person's seat, i.e., $p=0.5$."
