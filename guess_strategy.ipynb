    "### From New York Times, Science Times, D5, April 10, 2001:\n",
    "##### Three players enter a room and a red or blue hat is placed on each personâ€™s head. The color of each hat is determined by [an independent] coin toss. No communication of any sort is allowed, except for an initial strategy session before the game begins. Once they have had a chance to look at the other hats [but not their own], the players must simultaneously guess the color of their own hats or pass. The puzzle is to find a group strategy that maximizes the probability that at least one person guesses correctly and no-one guesses incorrectly. The naive strategy would be for the group to agree that one person should guess and the others pass. This would have probability 1/2 of success. Find a strategy with a greater chance for success."
